 I spent an hour on the homework roughly since I did it in chunks throughout today.

 I definitely spent the most time debugging because of tiny errors here and there so it to be more mindful with how I type words especially with case sensitive words which is different from when I used to use code editors like IntelliJ that autocomplete  certain things for you. The more I actually type out all the words myself is slowly getting more natural to do.

Iâ€™m enjoying the class so far. I really like the way examples are connected to the assignments because it helps me understand better and practice what we did in class.
